# Collection Development Policy

Main Policy: [https://web.library.yale.edu/collection-development-policy-books](https://web.library.yale.edu/collection-development-policy-books)

## Proposed Collection
To develop a collection of materials related to the 228 dog breeds listed on the American Kennel Club website (2023) including materials like: non-fiction novels, children's books, ethical breeding practices, history of the specific breeds, and materials from the respective parent clubs. 

## Types of Materials Collected

* Medical journals and articles.
* Generic pamphlets, depending on content.
* Fiction and Non-Fiction Materials (e.g. Books that have a specific breed as part of the main story).
* Parent Club Materials for historical purposes.
* Electronic resources are preferred if granted perpetual access under the contract of acquiring, otherwise, items should be acquired in print.
* Pedigrees of dogs to aid in the use of research regarding breeding practices.

## Policies
Any polices not described herein, please refer to the main policy (Yale University Library, 2023).

### Use Policy
There will be no restriction on the use of these materials and can be loaned via Interlibrary Loan. Chapters of digital items may be provided pursuant to the terms and conditions of the platform the items are provided through.

### Gift Policy
We will accept relevant material that meets the criteria above if they are in good condition. We will evaluate the material for uniqueness, and availability across OCLC libraries, and depending on the total number of copies we hold, and partner libraries hold, will determine if extra copies are weeded as needed, and based on demand.

### Purchasing Policy
The library should work to obtain the most affordable versions of the materials, with the least restrictive access policies tied to the item. If the material is electronic being purchased, it should be available perpetually, and ideally be available through either LOCKSS or Portico, to ensure access to the material if the vendor were to go out of business. 

### Weeding Policy

* Materials in poor condition may be removed and replaced as needed from the collection, and if there are additional copies in member libraries of OCLC. 
* While there is no maximum to the number of copies of each item, best judgment should be used based on usage data, and availability from member libraries of OCLC.

### Patron Request Policy
Please utilize the existing Purchase Request Form available to current members of the Yale community, found in the main policy.

## Policy Statement
The intent of this policy is to develop a repository of information for all recognized dog breeds by the American Kennel Club. Providing information to parent clubs, breeders, dog owners, dog enthusiasts, as well as those looking to do research on the origins and characteristics of a specific breed.
