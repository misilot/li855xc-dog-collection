# Dog Breed Information

This collection is the start of a twenty-year collection development process. The intention is to grow the collection over that time to contain information about the main different dog breeds, including fiction and non-fiction, information related to breeding, health and behavioral concerns, and general information about dogs. For more information please view our [Collection Policy](policy.md).

There will be information relevant to those who own dogs, veterinarians, breeders, and dog enthusiasts in general.

As materials are added to the collection, the intention is the items will be organized by breed, but also into general topics related to breeding, health information, training, etc... However, while we have a limited selection in the first year, the materials will be organized by breed only to start, with a general category for materials that cover multiple breeds or are related to dogs in general.
